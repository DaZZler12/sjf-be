This project implements the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm as a backend service using Go. It provides a complete CRUD interface for managing jobs in the queue, prioritizing them according to their execution time.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete jobs in the scheduler.
- **Priority Scheduling**: Automatically prioritizes jobs based on their execution time.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Efficiently manages concurrent job submissions and processing.
- **RESTful API**: Easy to use REST API for interacting with the scheduler.

## Getting Started
